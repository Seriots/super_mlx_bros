# super_mlx_bros
Do you know it ?

For fun, I made a mario game in C with MiniLibX !\
\
I don't make my own images, so i use super mario world images and the Dirt-&-Grass-2D-Platform-Tileset by AxualArt \
as game image.
\
Actually I have juste one map but if you want to do some map, you can and I'll be happy to add they. \
\
Have Fun !
